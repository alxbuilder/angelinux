<h2>How this site was put together</h2>

<p>
	This is my own website running on my own hardware from my own home.
	There is no reason why most people could not do exactly the same thing.
	Here is what you need, and what you need to do.
</p>

<h3>Hardware (a web server)</h3>

<p>
	There are many home servers and media boxes sold to serve content so if
	you already have something like this, you may be able to skip this step.
	Assuming you haven't, you could visit the <a href="http://excito.com/">
	B3 Store</a> like I did years ago.
</p>

<p>
	Alternatively, there is no reason why you could not run a server on a
	<a href="http://raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>.  There you will find
	all you need to get started including downloads and tutorials.  It can 
	help, to buy something <a href="http://modmypi.com/">preconfigured</a>
	to be sure you have everything you need.
</p>

<h3>A name for the site</h3>

<p>
	Names (like special car number plates) come at a price, often very little.
	For a cost, I could have got <i>http://angelinux<b>.org</b>/</i>.  My 
	<a href="http://no-ip.com">name provider</a> offers various names like
	<i>http://choose-a-name<b>.hopto.org</b></i>.  This can be seen by
	<a href="http://freedns.afraid.org/domain/dnstrace.php?domain=angelinux.hopto.org&submit=Trace">
	tracing</a> to this site.
</p>

<p>
	It seems this activity is catching on, and there will soon be
	a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.free">dotFree</a> domain.  And
	there are <a href="http://dnsdynamic.org/why.php">other things </a> you
	might want to do with your new powers!	
</p>

<h3>Some providers I've come across</h3>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://duckdns.org/">DuckDns</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://dnsdynamic.org/">DNSdynamic</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://dynu.com/">DYnu</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://freenom.com/">Freenom</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Dynamic DNS Service</h3>

<p>
	At it's simplest, DNS (Dynamic Name Service) is the reason why you can
	visit a website without knowing it's IP address, like the way you can
	dial from your contacts without remembering your friend's number.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately, unlike that analogy, your friends phone number doesn't
	constantly change, like your <a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com">
	IP address</a> does.  Unless you specifically ask and pay, providers
	<em>lease</em> and reassign those addresses not being used.
</p>

<p>
	So, what you need is a way to associate an unchanging site name with 
	a constantly changing address.  That is what dynamic DNS services offer.
</p>

<h3>Monitoring</h3>

<p>	I use 
	<a href="http://stats.pingdom.com/5woicuhs23qw/328711"> Pingdom</a>
	to keep an eye on this site from the outside.  I can recognise
	particular times from the history, such as when I moved house and
	was awaiting reconnection, and my horrendous downtimes after getting
	<a href="http://eircom.net">eFibre</a>.
