<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
	The Office of the Ombudsman markets itself as having &quot;30 years
	putting it right&quot; but has allowed public officials of whom I
	complained to act with impunity, and they have enjoyed doing so.
</p>

<p>
	My complaint is that I can't swim at my local swimming pool because of
	malicious complaints.  Among those responsible are local authority
	figures.  For that reason, Gardai were misdeployed to prevent me
	finding out more.  Despite this, I've been able to piece together
	what actually happened, and that no complaints have any credibility.
</p>

<h2>Vindication</h2>

<p>
	I have still not been vindicated despite bringing this to the
	attention of the former Garda Commissioner and the Ombudsman,
	having exhausted all <i>lesser</i> options up the chain, including
	many local representatives and one TD.
</p>

<p>
	The last I checked, a person has a constitutional right to their good
	name.  The Ombudsman's findings come in an envelope with a harp, so
	that's the <em>position of official Ireland</em>.  I won't settle for
	less, I want vindication in an envelope with a harp.
</p>

<h2>The problem with the Ombudsman</h2>

<p>
	Just about half way down 
	<a href="http://ombudsman.gov.ie/en/Make-a-Complaint/How-we-deal-with-your-complaint/">
	this page</a> is a section called &quot;Decision on your complaint&quot;
	that says they <em>uphold 15-20%</em> of complaints.  I don't
	expect this to mean that staff get paid 15-20% of their salaries.
	Are we really expected to believe that 80-85% of complaints are
	groundless or somehow motivated by boredom?
</p>

<p>
	There is an obvious problem with procedures when a finding is made
	without anybody sitting down <em>even once</em> with me to ask for
	my story.  This is because they received <i>&quot;a very detailed
	report&quot;</i> that contradicted my version of events, and think
	there's no need to check deeper.
</p>

<h2>Miswired Procedures</h2>
<p>
	Not under <em>Freedom of Information</em>, not under <em>Data
	Protection</em> have I been able to establish anything further, or have
	misinformation corrected.  Apart from who lied about me, I'd like to 
	know how much <em>taxpayer's money</em> was spent on this character 
	assassinating &quot;Council's report&quot;.
</p>

<h2>Gagging order</h2>
<p>
	Once my case has been assigned to a case worker for appeal,
	I'm told there will be no more chances to submit... and this before
	I've even spoken.  Information is coming to light all the time,
	(hopefully even more so after this), and I need it to be admissible.
</p>

<p>
	There is no &quot;<i>Other side</i>&quot; to this.  I want an oral
	hearing, because I will ease past any grilling from any party...
	others won't.  I have raised many other concerns that have not
	been addressed for <em>months</em>, and won't be ignored anymore.
</p>

<h2>How you can help</h2>

<p>
	Spread the word first of all... this shouldn't happen to anybody.
	The next person could be you unless social safety nets actually
	<em>work</em>.
</p>

<p>
	I am currently seeking employment, and this impediment is obstructing
	me from what I should be doing with my time.  See if I might match
	something in your organisation from my site or my
	<a href="http://ie.linkedin.com/in/mmcweeney/" >linked in</a> page.
</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't be asking if my name had a chance of being mentioned in
	reply to &quot;<i>Does anyone know somebody who can...?</i>&quot; 
	questions at work.  A decent break would solve <em>everything</em>
	just now... 
</p>

<p>
	In the meantime, I need practical help from neighbours and friends
	who have time and are in a position to help.  If you see me, please
	ask, and if you have any information, tell me (confidentially if
	needs be).
</p>

<h2>Thanks for your attention</h2>

<p>
	...and reading this far!  Help me become the last person who ever
	has to take a stand like this, and be grateful that it's me and
	not you that had to do it.
