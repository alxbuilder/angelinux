<h2>Invasion of privacy is <em>wrong</em></h2>

<p>
	Whether on your phone or on your computer, marketers want to
	<a href="/security/introduction"> as much as possible</a> about you.
	More comprehensive information about what you can do, see
	<a href="https://freedom.press/encryption-works" >this</a>, and
	play your part stopping them shoving their noses where they don't belong...
	
</p>

<h3>The <i>&quot;I'm doing nothing wrong&quot;</i> arguement</h3>
<p>
	Knowledge is power.  The <a href="http://eff.org">
	Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> have put together a <em>playlist</em>
	of <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/index">tutorials</a>.
	<ul>
		<li><em>At best</em>, your digital habits could be used to 
			present (or withhold) discounts in online shops.</li>
		<li>Your interest in a particular medicine could influence
			your next health insurance bill.</li>
	<li>Everything else I can think of is more sinister, but you get the idea.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Let's get started...</h3>

<p>
	For the time-starved, use
	<a href="http://propublica.org/article/privacy-tools-how-to-block-online-tracking">
	this propublica post</a> as a starting point.  Everybody's browsing and habits are
	different, so balance what privacy you want with what inconvenience you are
	prepared to experience while you accustomise.  Here are my recommendations:
</p>

<h3>Noscript</h3>
<a href="http://noscript.net/">http://noscript.net/</a>
<p>
	<img alt="noscript" src="/images/icons/noscript.png"
	title="Get noscript" />
	Finding a phone number online should have been a quick, simple conversation
	between two parties, but <em>so many</em> third parties butted in, analysing.
	Eliminate these delays by disabling these analytics for a faster experience.
</p>
<p>
	My tip for using this is to analyse what's being blocked, especially
	when visiting a frequently used site for the first time.  Youtube
	thumbnails, for example, won't show until you allow <em>ytimg</em>
	which, when you think about it, means Youtube images.  Expect 
	similar on other sites, but the result is well worth it.

<h3>Privacy Badger</h3>
<a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">https://www.eff.org/privacybadger</a>
<p>
	<img alt="privacy badger" src="/images/icons/privacy-badger.png"
	title="Get privacy badger" />
	There is a setting in your browser called <em>do not track</em> which you
	can <em>ask</em> websites not to track you.  This is a request, not a
	decree or order, and will be ignored by nasty sites.
</p>
<p>
	The privacy badger will impose a penalty on sites that ride roughshod over
	your request, and blacklist the offending sites, so you <em>disappear</em>
	from their radars.
</p>

<h3>Ghostery</h3>
<a href="http://ghostery.com/">http://ghostery.com/</a>
<p>
	<img alt="ghostery" src="/images/icons/ghostery.png"
	title="Get maskme" />
	Especially for phones, this is is an alternative to the <i>noscript</i>
	and <i>requestpolicy</i> that I use, and many users will probably find
	it simpler to use than using two tools.
</p>
<p>
	The purpose of this utility is to <em>track the trackers</em>, so you
	need have no qualms about information collected, it <em>is</em> for
	your benefit.
</p>

<div class="external">
<hr />
<h3>MaskMe</h3>
<a href="https://www.abine.com/maskme/">https://www.abine.com/maskme/</a>
<p>
	<img alt="maskme" src="/images/icons/maskme.png"
	title="Get maskme" />
	This gets around the problem of nosey websites asking for an email address
	or phone number you don't want to give.  For registered users, it 
	acts as a proxy, supplying a generated value to these sites.
</p>
<p>
	As a bonus, it will generate and remember <em>secure passwords</em>
	for you.  There are options to view the secure passwords, sync them
	for use on multiple browsers or devices.
</p>

<div class="external">

<h3>Https Everywhere</h3>
<a href="https://eff.org/https-everywhere/">https://eff.org/https-everywhere/</a>
<p>
	<img alt="https everywhere" src="/images/icons/eff.png"
	title="Get https everywhere" />
	Clear text is like a postcard.  Whoever sees it can read it.  That's
	<em>http</em>.  The <em>s</em> is for <em>secure</em> so this can't happen.
	Deciding what to share and with whom, is a decision
	that should be made by you, not by others.
</p>
<p>
	What you do in the privacy of your own home is not the business of a
	peeping Tom that decides to look in your window.  What you do on your
	computer is not the business of the next <em>online peeping Tom</em>
	that wants to sell you something through <em>Targetted advertising</em>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
	There are versions available for all the major browsers, which isn't
	true about the other tools here which are primarily for Gecko
	browsers like <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">firefox</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Request Policy</h3>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/">
	https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/</a>
<p>
	<img alt="request policy" src="/images/icons/request_policy.png"
	title="Get requestpolicy" />
	Tame those websites that redirect who they want to where they want,
	to run javascript for God knows who, or for what goal.  With this,
	each permission to redirect has to be explicitly granted, even for
	search engine results!
</p>

<p>
	Typically I use this to block analytics and speed up page loading.
	It <em>does</em> take a little getting used to, but in my opinion,
	it's well worth the effort.
