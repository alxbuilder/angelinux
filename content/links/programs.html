<h2>Don't be without these...</h2>

<p>
	These are the most essential utilities that
	<em>every</em> computer user should have.  Where
	possible, to keep things simple, I've favoured
	cross-platform applications, so now you have no excuse.

<h3>Office suites and word processing</h3>
<a href="http://libreoffice.org/">http://libreoffice.org/</a>

<p>
	<img alt="libre office" src="/images/icons/libreoffice.png"
	title="Get LibreOffice" />
	<img alt="open office" src="/images/icons/ooo.png"
	title="Get OpenOffice" />
	<img alt="abiword" src="/images/icons/abiword.png"
	title="Get Abiword" />
	Stop throwing money down the swanney buying Office software.
	Libre Office is a fully functional office suite, compatible
	with all open and proprietary document and presentation formats.
	The same can be said for OpenOffice, which has <i>come home</i>
	after a spell with Oracle, and is now an <a href="http://apache.org">
	apache</a> project.
</p>

<p>
	Abiword is a much lighter alternative for those not needing a full
	office suite, or using older, less powerful computers, and also
	fully supports all formats.

<h3>Jitsi</h3>

	Shake off the shackles of Skype, and replace it with an encrypted
	fully functional and compatible alternative.  Desktop sharing etc.
	is included.
</p>

<p>
	Because development is ongoing, install a stable build, and not a
	nightly.  Downloads are clearly identified as one or the other.

<h3>Bleachbit</h3>
<a href="http://bleachbit.com/">http://bleachbit.com/</a>
<p>
	<img alt="bleachbit" src="/images/icons/bleachbit.png"
	title="Get bleachbit" />
	Imagine a kitchen where nobody cleans up after themselves.
	Not a pretty picture, but this is what almost every program on
	your computer is doing... image viewers, video thumbnailers etc.
	etc.
</p>

<p>
	Now imagine what the picture will be like after a week, a month...
	how long since you bought that thing?  In any case, time for a
	cleanup.  Less files means faster file retrieval, before we even
	touch the issue of privacy.

<h3>Noscript</h3>
<a href="http://noscript.net/">http://noscript.net/</a>
<p>
	<img alt="noscript" src="/images/icons/noscript.png"
	title="Get noscript" />
	I once wanted to find a phone number online, and had some naive
	expectation that the request would be quick and simple.  It should
	have been, but it seemed like 10 sites all wanted to analyse every
	keystroke.  This delayed the response considerably.
</p>

<p>
	My tip for using this is to analyse what's being blocked, especially
	when visiting a frequently used site for the first time.  Youtube
	thumbnails, for example, won't show until you allow <em>ytimg</em>
	which, when you think about it, means Youtube images.  Expect 
	similar on other sites, but the result is well worth it.

<h3>Request Policy</h3>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/">
	https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/</a>
<p>
	<img alt="request policy" src="/images/icons/request_policy.png"
	title="Get requestpolicy" />
	Tame those websites that redirect who they want to where they want,
	to run javascript for God knows who, or for what goal.  With this,
	each permission to redirect has to be explicitly granted, even for
	search engine results!
</p>

<p>
	Typically I use this to block analytics and speed up page loading.
	It <em>does</em> take a little getting used to, but in my opinion,
	it's well worth the effort.

<h3>MaskMe</h3>
<a href="https://www.abine.com/maskme/">https://www.abine.com/maskme/</a>
<p>
	<img alt="maskme" src="/images/icons/maskme.png"
	title="Get maskme" />
	This is one I like a <em>lot</em>, and it's only a taster of what's
	available from the same place.  This gets around the problem of
	nosey websites asking for an email address or phone number you don't
	want to give.
</p>

<p>
	As a bonus, it will generate and remember <em>secure passwords</em>
	for you.  There are options to view the secure passwords, sync them
	for use on multiple browsers or devices.

<h3>Ghostery</h3>
<a href="http://ghostery.com/">http://ghostery.com/</a>
<p>
	<img alt="ghostery" src="/images/icons/ghostery.png"
	title="Get maskme" />
	This is is an alternative to the <i>noscript</i> and 
	<i>requestpolicy</i> that I use, and many users will probably find
	it simpler to use than using two tools.
</p>

<p>
	There are versions available for all the major browsers, which isn't
	true about the other tools here which are primarily for Gecko
	browsers like <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">firefox</a>.
