<h2>Don't be without these...</h2>

<p>
	These are the most essential utilities that
	<em>every</em> computer user should have.  Where
	possible, to keep things simple, I've favoured
	cross-platform applications, so now you have no excuse.

<h3>Office suites and word processing</h3>

	<img alt="libre office" src="/images/icons/libreoffice.png"

	Stop throwing money down the swanney buying Office software.
	Libre Office is a fully functional office suite, compatible
	with all open and proprietary document and presentation formats.
	The same can be said for OpenOffice, which has <i>come home</i>
	after a spell with Oracle, and is now an <a href="http://apache.org">
	apache</a> project.
</p>

<p>
	Abiword is a much lighter alternative for those not needing a full
	office suite, or using older, less powerful computers, and also
	fully supports all formats.

<h3>Bleachbit</h3>

	Imagine a kitchen where nobody cleans up after themselves.
	Not a pretty picture, but this is what almost every program on
	your computer is doing... image viewers, video thumbnailers etc.
	etc.
</p>

<p>
	Now imagine what the picture will be like after a week, a month...
	how long since you bought that thing?  In any case, time for a
	cleanup.  Less files means faster file retrieval, before we even
	touch the issue of privacy.

	Shake off the shackles of Skype, and replace it with an encrypted
	fully functional and compatible alternative.  Desktop sharing etc.
	is included.
</p>

<p>
	Because development is ongoing, install a stable build, and not a
	nightly.  Downloads are clearly identified as one or the other.
