	This page will most probably become the starting point for documenting

	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="/fixes/vm/docker" title="Virtualisation on the cheap">
				Docker</a> Use as much of your host Linux box in your virtualised box!
		</li>
		<li>
				<a href="/fixes/deploy/cli-new-git" title="Git deployment from Bash">
				Fire Safety, basic Git</a> Bump up a directory to Github, the lazy way.
		</li>
