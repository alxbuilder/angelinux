<h2>Quick start entry points to Ruby Programming</h2>
<p>
	There's a sense of nostalgia seeing some of my earliest programming experiences
	<a href="http://groups.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/index.html">listed
	</a> at one startpoint, and it's hard not to revisit some for old time's sake.
</p>

<p>
	My own personal favourite language is Ruby, because it helps when you need it,
	leaves you alone when you don't, and has a tolerant syntax.
	The best and most comprehensive guide to Ruby is the <em>Pickaxe book</em>.
</p>

<p>
	Ideally beyond that, you'll want a framework suitable for the project, and for
	smaller scale projects, you don't want a big framework.  For that reason, I like
	<em>Sinatra</em> and it's bigger brother <em>Padrino</em>.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with static sites, and there are plenty of
	<a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net/"> tools</a> to create them.  Over a
	recent weekend I tried quite a lot of these, and concluded of those that
	didn't spectacularly crash, I could be most productive with <em>nanoc</em>.
