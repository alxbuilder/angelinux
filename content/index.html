<h3>Privacy section updated!</h3>
<p>
	Online privacy is a big issue and one we should all take absolutely
	seriously, and it's set to become even more so, and at a faster speed than
	we realise.  The new security section is as a result of extensive research
	on the state of play of both threats and defenses, carried out in
	Oct / Nov 2014.  Have a read and find out what I did in a fraction of
	the time.
</p>
<p>
	Now ask yourself a question: <em>With what trackers already know, from
	facebook, phone geolocation etc., what happens when your online activity
	gets matched to loyalty cards (or other) purchases in supermarkets, or
	your posts and comments are run through lexical analysers</em>? 
	<b>If you don't pay for the product, then you probably <em>are</em> 
	the product</b>.
</p>
<p>
	My concern is that these <em>digital footprints</em> will eventually
	turn into a <em>digital tattoo</em> that follows you everywhere, and
	over which you will have little (if any) control.
	Will the <em>digital shrink</em> skew the world's perceptions of who
	we really are?

<h3>Fix crooked Ireland</h3>
<p>
	My patience has finally run out, and I've decided it's time to
	<a href="/about/protest">protest</a>.  I have much better things
	to do with my time, but any ordinary person could be driven to
	this, given similar circumstances.  All support welcome.
</p>

<h2>Priority work</h2>
<p>
	Very soon I hope to reintroduce remote support over
	<a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/"> Reverse VNC</a>,
	so I can make my 20+ years of Linux experience available to
	the masses.
</p>

<p>
	This is particularly important as I reinvent as a web developer.
	This site is written primarily in Ruby, compiled and deployed.
	More details <a href="/about/thissite"> here</a>.

<h3>What is Angelinux?</h3>
<p>
	Angelinux is my own spin of <a href="http://linuxfromscratch.org/">
	Linux from Scratch</a>.  The ultimate goal is to create a
	functionality to automate the build.  The obvious reason being that
	while it's <em>very</em> educational to do, timewise, it's a pain
	where you don't want one!
</p>

<p>
	So, by automating the tedium, more of this time can be spent on the 
	<em>real</em> benefits of customisation such as packages and kernel.
	This is even more painful, <em>BUT</em> it's	a once-off so it's
	worth it.
</p>



<h3>Still under heavy construction...</h3>
<p>
	In the coming weeks (and months), I'm hoping to retrieve the material from the
	previous iteration of this site, and most of that will be available
	in the <a href="./linux">linux</a> section.
</p>

	And it's coming back, I'll be reintroducing the <em>Support</em>
	section where you can hand over your troublesome device to me over
	the internet.
