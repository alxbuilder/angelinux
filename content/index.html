<h3>Fix crooked Ireland</h3>
<p>
	My patience has finally run out, and I've decided it's time to
	<a href="/about/protest">protest</a>.  I have much better things
	to do with my time, but any ordinary person could be driven to
	this, given similar circumstances.  All support welcome.
</p>

<h2>Priority work</h2>
<p>
	Another priority will be to reintroduce remote support over
	<a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/"> Reverse VNC</a>,
	so I can make my 20+ years of Linux experience available to
	the masses.
</p>
<p>
	This is particularly important as I reinvent as a web developer.
	This site is written primarily in Ruby, compiled and deployed.

<h3>What is Angelinux?</h3>
<p>
	Angelinux is my own spin of <a href="http://linuxfromscratch.org/">
	Linux from Scratch</a>.  The ultimate goal is to create a
	functionality to automate the build.  The obvious reason being that
	while it's <em>very</em> educational to do, timewise, it's a pain
	where you don't want one!
</p>

<p>
	So, by automating the tedium, more of this time can be spent on the 
	<em>real</em> benefits of customisation such as packages and kernel.
	This is even more painful, <em>BUT</em> it's	a once-off so it's
	worth it.
</p>

<h3>Privacy and other stuff</h3>
<p>
	Recent social media trends, loyalty cards, tracking and analytics
	have led to a <em>serious</em> erosion of privacy not only of all
	internet users, but of ordinary shoppers, with the average user 
	engaging in what I call	<cite>inadvertant digital prostitution</cite>.
</p>
<p>
	I will try to provide pointers to help you protect yourself online,
	and in particular, how to avoid the potential pitfalls the future
	is likely to offer.
</p>

<h3>Because this is a new site...</h3>
<p>
	In the next few weeks, I'm hoping to retrieve the material from the
	previous iteration of this site, and most of that will be available
	in the <a href="./linux">linux</a> section.
</p>
<p>
	And it's coming back, I'll be reintroducing the <em>Support</em>
	section where you can hand over your troublesome device to me over
	the internet.
