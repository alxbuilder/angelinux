<h2>Get started with Docker Containers</h2>

<p>
	Virtualisation is by any standards, cool technology.
	The ability to fire up disposable hardware is very useful
	for tests in an isolated environment but has significant
	overhead, but <a href="http://docker.com"> docker </a>
	significantly <a href="http://docker.com/whatisdocker"> 
	reduces</a> this overhead by sharing the kernel.
</p>

<p>
	Many moons ago, I researched
	<a href="http://linuxcontainers.org/">linux containers</a> and 
	<a href="http://filesystems.org/project-unionfs.html">UnionFS</a>
	filesystems.  UnionFS is well described on
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionFS"> Wikipedia"</a>.
	Both show up as key components in <a href="http://docker.com/">
	Docker</a>.
</p>

<h2>Why is Docker cooler?</h2>
<p>
	Traditional virtualisation overheads are high.  All hardware has
	to be recreated.  Because Docker is a container technology, it
	simply re-purposes the already running infrastructure, mapping
	itself into the container, eliminating duplication.  As a result,
	Docker containers are much more lightweight and faster to deploy
	on any platform.

<p>
	An online tutorial is available on the docker site 
	<a href="http://docker.com/tryit/"> here</a>.  My own personal
	initial experiments are <a href="/fixes/vm/run-docker/" >here</a>.
