<h2>Don't reinvent the wheel</h2>

<p>
	At some point this will probably turn into a blog, but on a
	daily basis, there is always piles of stuff to fix.  At the
	moment, while this site is a refugee on a
	<a href="http://raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, it's
	natural host, a <a href="http://excito.com/">Bubba</a> server
	is being upgraded from <a href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a>
	Etch to <em>at least</em> Squeeze if not Wheezy.
</p>	

<p>
	Etch to Squeeze or Wheezy is a long journey, made no easier by
	software selections that regularly required the
	<a href="http://www.debianhelp.co.uk/debianproblem.htm">forcing
	</a> of selections.	See 
	<a href="/fixes/bubba-upgrade/index.html" >this page</a>
	for details.
</p>

<p>
	The idea here is to dig out all those archives and pendrives
	with their hundreds and hundreds of hacks, fixes, discoveries
	and other gems, show them to the world, and save myself some
	headaches.
