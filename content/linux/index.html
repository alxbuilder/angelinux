<h2>Install Linux</h2>

<p>
	Windows 8 is an <em>abomination</em> that requires a <em>custom
	install</em> to avoid keeping an online account with Microsoft.
	<ul>
		<li>Have people learned nothing from Edward Snowden?</li>
		<li>Why would you need an account with Microsoft to use a computer?</li>
		<li>What do they want to know?</li>
		<li>Who are they passing details of your activities on to?</li>
		<li>Do you tell your car manufacturer where you drive their car?</li>
	</ul>
	Thankfully dumping windows couldn't get much easier.  From here you
	can <a href="http://goodbye-microsoft.com/" >install Debian</a> while
	keeping your existing Windows system until you're comfortable.  Before
	you do, give your computer a sporting chance of performing by following
	the instructions below which can dramatically improve performance.
</p>

<h3>What to do now...</h3>
<p>
	Some of the steps outlined here require booting from <em>Live CD</em>s.
	To write a CD from an image (.iso) file, windows users will need a
	program such as <a href="http://imgburn.com/">imgburn</a>, simply
	copying an <i>ISO</i> file to a blank CD will <em>not</em> produce a
	bootable disk, that's the classic mistake.
</p>
<p>
	Your first decision to is whether to keep Windows and <em>dual boot</em>.
	The vast majority of Linux installations onto Windows computers produce
	a menu at boot time allowing you to choose which system to boot.
	If you intend to keep your Windows installation for whatever reason
	then follow the instructions below.  Otherwise simply jump to

		<li><h3>Warning</h3>
			<p>If you have <em><i>ever</i></em> done shopping on your PC,
			then your <em>digital rubbish</em> is going to be still
			on your hard disk, so <em>DO NOT DISCARD IT</em> before
			wiping the disk clean, for the very same reason as you
			shred confidential documents.
			</p>
		</li>
		<br /><hr />
		
		<li><h3 id="dban">Forensic disk wipe</h3>
			<p>Use <a href="http://dban.org/">Darik's Boot and Nuke</a>
			to create a bootable live CD which you can boot your
			computer from.  This will present a menu of options, all
			of which work, that allow a <em>total forensic wipe</em>
			of your disk, bringing it back to factory condition.
			This same utility is available on the 
			<a href="http://sysresccd.org/">System Rescue CD</a>,
			which <em>no self-respecting</em> computer user should
			be without!!

		<li><h3>The bad fix, speeding up XP</h3>
			<p>
			First off, this is a <em><i>VERY BAD IDEA</i></em> as XP
			is no longer supported so there will be <em><i>no future
			security fixes</i></em>, or defence against malicious
			software, viruses, trojans and worms.  So for those who
			absolutely insist, <em>you have been warned</em>, and
			consider this <i>fix</i> a temporary measure.
			</p>
			<p>
			The way I explain this is to get people to imagine a
			kitchen where nobody cleans up.  After one meal, there's
			a mess.  Now imagine it after a day, a week... a year?
			Every web page, gallery, flash-commercial etc. leaves it's
			crumbs behind on your disk.  This may have gone on from
			the very time the computer was bought.

			<h3>Speeding up any slow windows box...</h3>
			<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Purge waste and private data</b>
				<p>
				Get <a href="http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net">
				Bleachbit</a> (my preference, and it's cross-platform).
				This can drastically reduce the number of files on the
				disk.  Less files means that the files you want to open
				can be much more easily found.
				</p>
				<br /><hr />
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Defragment the hard disk</b>
				<p>
				To defragment a hard disk under windows, use Windows
				explorer to navigate to the disk (usually C: drive).
				Once there, right click and find defragment on the
				menu.
				</p>
				<p><b>Note: </b> Be prepared to run this overnight,
				and don't expect the computer to be usable while this
				is running.
				</p>
				<br /><hr />

			<li>
				<b>Install Linux</b>
				<p>
				There are numerous linux distributions suitable for use
				on computers of all ages and capabilities.  Many come as
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD">Live CD
				</a>s, many of which are installable.
				</p>
				<p>
				The handiest site for getting Linux or Linux Live CDs
				is <a href="http://distrowatch.com">Distrowatch</a>.
