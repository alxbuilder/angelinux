<h2>Dump Windows</h2>

<p>
	Windows 8 is an <em>abomination</em> that requires a <em>custom
	install</em> to avoid keeping an online account with Microsoft.
	Have people learned nothing from Edward Snowden?
</p>

<h3>Install Linux</h3>

<p>
	Thankfully dumping windows couldn't get much easier.  From here you
	can <a href="http://goodbye-microsoft.com/" >install Debian</a> while
	keeping your existing Windows system until you're comfortable.
</p>

<h3>What to do now...</h3>

<p>
	<ol>
		<li><h3>Wipe the disk</h3>
			If you have <em><i>ever</i></em> done shopping on your PC,
			then your <em>digital rubbish</em> is going to be still
			on your hard disk, so <em>DO NOT DISCARD IT</em> before
			wiping the disk clean, for the very same reason as you
			shred confidential documents.<br />
		</li>

		<li><h3>Here's how</h3>
			Use <a href="http://dban.org/">Darik's Boot and Nuke</a>
			to create a bootable live CD which you can boot your
			computer from.  This will present a menu of options, all
			of which work, that allow a <em>total forensic wipe</em>
			of your disk, bringing it back to factory condition.
			This same utility is available on the 
			<a href="http://sysresccd.org/">System Rescue CD</a>,
			which <em>no self-respecting</em> computer user should
			be without!!<br />
		</li>
		
		<li><h3>The bad fix, speeding up XP</h3>
			<p>
			First off, this is a <em><i>VERY BAD IDEA</i></em> as XP
			is no longer supported so there will be <em><i>no future
			security fixes</i></em>, or defence against malicious
			software, viruses, trojans and worms.  So for those who
			absolutely insist, <em>you have been warned</em>, and
			consider this <i>fix</i> a temporary measure.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The way I explain this is to get people to imagine a
			kitchen where nobody cleans up.  After one meal, there's
			a mess.  Now imagine it after a day, a week... a year?
			Every web page, gallery, flash-commercial etc. leaves it's
			crumbs behind on your disk.  This may have gone on from
			the very time the computer was bought.

			<h3>Wipe private data from you disk...</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<b>Clean up temporary files</b>
				<p>
				Get <a href="http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net">
				Bleachbit</a> (my preference, and it's cross-platform).
				This can drastically reduce the number of files on the
				disk.  Less files means that the files you want to open
				can be much more easily found.

				<li>
				<b>Defragment the hard disk</b>
				<p>
				To defragment a hard disk under windows, use Windows
				explorer to navigate to the disk (usually C: drive).
				Once there, right click and find defragment on the
				memu.
				</p>
				<p><b>Note: </b> Be prepared to run this overnight,
				and don't expect the computer to be usable while this
				is running.
				</p>
				<hr />
				</li>

				<li>
				<b>Install Linux</b>
				<p>
				There are numerous linux distributions suitable for use
				on computers of all ages and capabilities.  Many come as
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD">Live CD
				</a>s, many of which are installable.
				</p>
				<p>
				The handiest site for getting Linux or Linux Live CDs
				is <a href="http://distrowatch.com">Distrowatch</a>.
