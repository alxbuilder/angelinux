<h2>Things you should know...</h2>

<p>
	Edward Snowden's accounts of 
	<a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/nsa-targets-users-of-privacy-services/">
	mass surveillance</a> have led many, myself included, to reassess security.
	To be called <em>extremists</em> (as that article does), for having these
	concerns, is a clear sign that things are happening that shouldn't.
</p>
<p>	
	To be honest, nothing that came out particularly surprised me.  To be protected to
	an acceptable level, you really need to be using the
	<a href="http://torproject.org"> Tor Browser Bundle</a>, which raises a big
	red flag all by itself!
</p>
<p>
	To make sure this section is as accurate as possible, I took on board 
	<a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-linkability">
	The Tor Perspective
	</a>, and based on that and other research, I hope this is accessible to most users.
</p>
<p>
	For anyone who just wants a faster user experience, without worrying about
	<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en-GB">
	the technical details</a> should start by	
	<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/eula.html">
	Blocking Google Analytics</a>, used on a huge slew of sites.

		<li><h3>Browser Fingerprints</h3>
			Your browser has a <a href="/security/fingerprint" >fingerprint</a>.
			and if you're not using a <a name="stock browser"
			title="browser on a mass-produced phone or tablet">stock browser</a>,
			then you can assume it's as unique as your finger's print, and even
			if it's not, your device ID <em>is</em>.
			<br />
			All the unique attributes of your device, language, timezone,
			software versions and plugins all combine to make browsers unique.

		<li><h3>Don't <em>addthis</em>... don't do lots of things!</h3>
			Variations in setups that allow 
			<a href="http://www.geek.com/apps/canvas-fingerprinting-is-like-a-cookie-you-cant-block-and-thousands-of-sites-are-using-it-1599967/">
			browser fingerprinting</a>	have the knock-on effect that each browser
			<a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/meet-the-online-tracking-device-that-is-virtually-impossible-to-block#">
			draws in a unique way</a> on what's called the HTML5 <em>canvas</em> tag.
			Try the demonstration on the link, it's polite enough to ask your permission.
			<br />
			The above link not only shows a demonstration of the technique in
			action, but also publishes a
			<a href="https://securehomes.esat.kuleuven.be/~gacar/persistent/canvas_urls.html">
			wall of shame</a>	of offending sites, the top three of which seem to be
			<a name="addthis" title="http://addthis.com"><em>addthis</em></a>,
			<a name="ligatus" title="http://ligatus.com"><em>ligatus</em></a> and
			<a name="plentyoffish" title="http://pof.com"><em>plentyoffish</em></a>.
		</li>
		<p>
			All indications are that Addthis are
			<a href="http://mashable.com/2014/07/21/impossible-block-tracking-tool/">
			unapologetic</a>, and the code upon which they built is still
			<a href="http://valve.github.io/blog/2013/07/14/anonymous-browser-fingerprinting/">
			in the wild</a>.
			This is partularly nasty and underhand, and it has already been
			suggested
			that this technique be used to replace
			traditional cookies.
