<h2>The start of trouble</h2>
<p>
	There was a time when the mere suggestion of what's below would have
	(and did) attract derision and cries of <em>paranoia</em>.  Back at
	time of the launch of Windows XP, Microsoft strenuously denied
	suggestions that those boxes
	<a href="http://www.computerbytesman.com/privacy/wmp8dvd.htm">
	phoned home</a>	on encrypted
	connections to Microsoft servers, reporting usage and other statistics.
</p>
<p>
	Around that time, a lot of activism focused around the introduction of
	<a href="http://defectivebydesign.org/" title="Digital Restrictions Management">
	DRM</a> which was either tagged as Digital
	<a title="No, it's not, it's RESTRICTIONS really">Rights</a>/<em>Restrictions</em>
	management, depending on who you asked.

<h2>A job to do</h2>
<p>
	Back then it was all about the starving artist.  This was the latest defense
	of the <i>Home taping is killing music, and it's ILLEGAL</i> argument.
	While there was a possible justification for keeping artists fed, there
	is <em>no justification</em> for 
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media/"> embedding DRM in HTML5</a>.
	Content providers never explained this to the masses before devices
	started shipping to the masses from the likes of Apple, Tivo, Amazon and others.

<h3>What Digital Restrictions Management Facilitates</h3>

<p>
	The real problem with this technology is what it facilitates,
	and what it could be used for in the future, rather than
	what it does right now, although that situation is changing fast as the
	<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2400985,00.asp">
	Windows kill switch</a>shows.  <em>Data rot</em> is the control
	mechanism of the future.

	<li><em>Multimedia</em>
		The media will only play on an <em>approved</em> device.
		So, who approves and on what criteria?  In practice it meant
		a single device like an iPod.			
	</li>
	<li><em>EBooks</em>
		The Amazon Kindle is the example that jumps out.

<h2>Post Snowden landscape</h2>
<p>
	Fast forward a few years and now it's about prevention of terror.
	There was a time when suspicions that encrypted communications were

	siphoned</a> before sent were dismissed,
	<a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/windows-8-prism-edition">not anymore</a>.
	These practices are both

	</a>revealed and
	<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded">
	analysed</a>.
</p>

<p>
	It is also well documented that before releasing security patches, Microsoft first

	pass data</a> from the exploit to the NSA and it's
	<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">
	not just Microsoft</a>.

	More is known about us than has ever been known, and it's being used
	<em>NOT for security</em> but to plant

	The implants can enable the NSA to circumvent privacy-enhancing encryption 
	tools that are used to browse the Internet anonymously or scramble the 
	contents of emails as they are being sent across networks. 
	<br />
	That’s because the <em>NSA’s malware gives</em> 
	the agency unfettered <em>access</em> to a target’s 
	computer <em>before</em> the user protects their 
	communications with <em>encryption</em>.
