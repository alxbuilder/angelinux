<h2>Getting Angelinux</h2>

<h3>Schema</h3>
<p>
	From now on, we should get used to seeing <em>things</em> on the
	web being represented with metadata from <a href="http://schema.org/">
	schema.org</a>.  My linux distribution is one such
	<a href="http://schema-creator.org/product.php">product</a>... and by
	the way, the rating of 10 based on one review <em>was</em> me.

from <a href="http:///spideroak.com/" title="SpiderOak">SpiderOak</a>.  For the
record, that's no small achievement, to build your own operating system, and not
one I've so far had the time to repeat.  Anyway the current version is 0.38.
The image can be written to and SD card or USB stick (1GB is enough).
Here's how...
</p>

<h3>Step 1 - What's our target media</h3>

<p>
	Before inserting your media (USB stick or SD Card), open a linux terminal.
	We want to know what device name will be given to the device by the 
	<em>udev</em> device management system.  This command lets you to find out:
</p>

<code class="usercode">cat /proc/partitions</code>

<p>Here's what you might see...</p>

<pre>
<p class="output">
major minor  #blocks  name

   8        0  976762584 sda
   8        1     248832 sda1
   8        2    5999616 sda2
   8        3    3999744 sda3
   8        4          1 sda4
   8        5   31998976 sda5
  11        0    1048575 sr0
   8       16    7816704 sdb
   8       17    7816688 sdb1
</p>
</pre>
<br />

<h3>Step 2 - Partitions including our media</h3>

<p>
	Now plug in the device and repeat the above command.  The device with the
	highest letter will be the most recently plugged in device.<br />
	A typical device name would be <code>/dev/sdb</code> which would show it's
	partition in <code>/proc/partitions</code> as <code>/dev/sdb1</code>, as
	the typical device is sold with a single <code>vfat</code> partition.
</p>

<p>
	Depending on how <em>udev</em> is configured, that vfat partition may be
	automatically mounted, if so, it will need to be <em>unmounted</em>
	before proceeding.  Just to be safe, issue this command before the write,
	modifying if the device was assigned a different letter (for example, it
	could have been called /dev/sd<b>c</b>1 if the computer already had two
	installed hard disks or other media.
</p>

<code class="rootcode">umount /dev/sdb1</code>
<br />

<p>
	If the device was not mounted, that command will give a harmless error.
	Now we are ready to create the media, here's the command you'll need:
</p>

<code class="rootcode">
dd if=angelinux<strong>&lt;VERSION&gt;</strong>.img of=/dev/<strong>&lt;MYMEDIA&gt;</strong> conv=sync,noerror bs=512 count=1280<br>
</code>
<br />

<h3>What that all meant...</h3>

<ul>
	<li><code>dd</code> - <em>Device to Device</em> copy command.
						Take something (an image file on hard disk),
						and copy it to something else (USB or SD Card).
		 </li>
	<li><code>if=</code> - <em>Input File</em>, in this case our image.</li>
	<li><code>of=</code> - <em>Output File</em>, the USB Stick or SD Card</li>
	<li><code>conv=</code> -<em>Conversion</em> options: I like to specify:</li>
	<li><code>sync,noerror</code> - Retry on error, and don't use cache.</li>
	<li><code>bs=</code> - <em>Block size</em> to write at a time.  This is the
						option you can be least fussy about. 512 * 2 * anything
						up to 4M will be fine, but if using different options,
						don't forget to divide the count (if specified) by the
						same amount.	
		</li>
	<li><code>count=</code> - How many blocks of <code>bs</code> to copy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>And just in case it's not obvious...</h3>
<p>
	In the above command, modify as follows:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>&lt;VERSION&gt;</b> - The version number from the downloaded file.</li>
	<li><b>&lt;MYMEDIA&gt;</b> - is the device you're writing the image to.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3 - Check everything</h3>
<p>
	Once the <em>dd</em> command has completed, <strong>without further
	ado</strong>, establish if that previous command successfully completed.
</p>

<code class="rootcode">
echo $?
</code>

<p>
	If that comes back with <code>0</code>, then the write was successful.
	Any other value <code>1</code> or above means there was some problem.
</p>

<h3>Step 4 - Check that the final image is error free</h3>
<br />

<code class="usercode">
md5sum -c angelinux0.38.md5
</code>

<p>
	The output will look like this, and <code>OK</code> displayed
	if the written image is intact.
</p>

<p class="output">
282fbd4b6b4453fbec1c60d22fc13840  angelinux0.38.img 
</p>
<br />

<br />
<h3>Step 5 - Boot from the image</h3>
<p>
	Apart from contrary BIOSes, your computer should now boot from the image.
	<b>Enjoy!</b>
