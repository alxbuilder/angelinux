<h2>Woops, I thought those were deleted</h2>

<h3>Rant</h3>
<p>
	One of Window's worst user interface features has <em>always</em>
	been it's annoying habit of (not just) second-guessing, but knowing
	better than the user.
</p>
<p>
	For now, I'll lay off a little, because it turns out that files I
	deleted had been instead <em>moved</em> to a <i>hidden</i> place
	for me.
</p>

<h3>Action</h3>
<p>
	I will be very disappointed if I find out that this is something that
	<a href="http://freedesktop.org">FreeDesktop.org</a> have endorsed,
	because I can't imagine a lightweight desktop like 
	<a href="http://lxde.org" >LXDE</a> would have come up with it.
	The main problem with simpler solutions than this one is that they 
	won't work because of the spaces within directory or file names.
</p>

<h3>The manual fix</h3>
<p>
	In case I ever need to do this again, I just need to use a different 
	directory name but the <code>sed</code> code will remain the same.
</p>
<p>
	Essentially what it does is put a single quote before and after the
	filenames, telling the shell that the whole thing should be considered,
	and that the space does not represent the start of the next filename.
</p>

<pre><code class="usercode">
cd ~/.local/share/Trash && \
find . -type f -print |sed -e s/^./\'./g -e s/\\\(.$\\\)/\\1\'/g
</code></pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
	What we need here is to use <code>sed</code>'s placeholder feature.
	Here's a sample line containing a file to delete, (spot the spaces):
	<br /><code>
	./info/angelinux and other stuff_files.trashinfo
	</code><br />
	For this to be considered one file, we need to delete (note the quotes)
	<br /> <code><em>'</em>./info/angelinux and other 
	stuff_files.trashinfo<em>'</em></code> <br />
</p>

<p>
	In sed and many other contexts, <code>^</code> is the beginning of a
	line and <code>$</code> is the end, and <code>.</code> matches exactly
	one character.
</p>
<p>
	As luck would have it, this makes the first <em>edit string</em> very
	simple, because the first character in the example is itself a <em>.</em>
</p>

<p>
	The end of line is slightly trickier because we can't afford to lose the
	last character and replace it with a dot like before.  What we do is trap
	it inside brackets, and in the replace string, drop the first thing we
	trapped.
</p>

<p>
	The difficulty is that <code>\</code>, <code>(</code>, and <code>)</code>
	are all special characters and require to be escaped with <code>\</code>
	to achieve the context that we want. 
</p>

<p>
	An alternative to all this is the <code>srm</code> command which shreds
	and removes these files.  To do this, <code>cd</code> into the required
	directory and <code class="usercode">srm -rvd *</code> to recursively
	and securely delete the files.
